                <p>I grew up in San Jose, but have been living in San Diego ever since attending San Diego State University
                    I graduated in 2010 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics, with a minor in finance. 
                </p>
                <p>Ever since graduating I have been working for a bankrtupcty law firm. I have held many positions within
                    the company, but have not found any of them fulfilling for very long. That is why I enrolled in the UCSD Extension
                    Coding Bootcamp. I am excited to learn a challenging, marketable skill that will give me a great opportunity 
                    for career growth.
